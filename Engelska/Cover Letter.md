## Personal Statement

**Hello,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your company. I am a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong desire to contribute to exciting projects and deliver high-quality code. I believe that my experience and technical expertise can be a valuable asset to your team.

### Background

My passion for IT has been with me since I was young. It was during my high school years that my interest in programming really took off, and I began to explore various programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, and PHP.

This fascination with technology and programming led me to decide to further my education as a software developer specializing in .NET at the Borås Vocational University. During this period, I also had the unique opportunity to intern at Volvo Powertrain in Gothenburg.

In my spare time, I play football, which has given me valuable teamwork skills and developed my ability to collaborate effectively with others.

### Internship at Volvo Powertrain

During my internship, which lasted for about half a year, I had the privilege of working within a C# development team focused on creating an internal application for Volvo. This experience was invaluable and gave me deep insights into working in a real, agile work environment.

During my time at Volvo Powertrain, I actively participated in the development of the internal application. I worked closely with the team to design and implement solutions, strengthening my skills in C# development and my ability to collaborate effectively with colleagues.

This internship also gave me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of agile development and its principles. I gained experience in handling requirements from various stakeholders, managing project timelines, and delivering solutions that met high-quality standards.

This period at Volvo was a significant milestone in my career and helped me develop practical skills and insights that I can now apply in my work as a software developer.

### Technical Skills

I have gained solid experience in languages such as C#, Javascript, and Typescript. Additionally, I have knowledge of React, MySQL, and agile development. I am passionate about producing clean and efficient code and am dedicated to following best practices in web development.

**Best regards,**

Hampus Andersson
