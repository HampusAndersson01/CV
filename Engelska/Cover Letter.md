## Cover Letter

**Hello,**

I'm Hampus Andersson, a recent graduate in software development with a keen interest in technology. After completing my education in .NET at Borås Vocational University and interning at Volvo Powertrain in Gothenburg, I am eager to embark on my career in software development.

### Background

My fascination with technology began during high school, where I explored various programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and PHP. My education as a software developer and my time at Volvo Powertrain have not only provided me with a solid foundation but also practical insights into applying my skills.

### Internship at Volvo Powertrain

My time within a C# development team at Volvo Powertrain was an intense and educational period where I actively participated in the development of an internal application. Working in an agile environment became a natural part of my daily routine, and I look forward to applying these experiences in future assignments.

### Technical Skills

I have a strong background in C#, Javascript, and Typescript, along with knowledge in React, MySQL, and agile development. Continuing to develop these skills and applying them to practical and efficient solutions is one of my main goals as a software developer.

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to your projects and further develop in a dynamic work environment. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter, and I hope for the opportunity to discuss how I can be an asset to your team.

**Kind regards,**

Hampus Andersson
