## Cover Letter

Hi,

I'm Hampus, a software developer who graduated in 2023 with a focus on .NET development. I'm reaching out because I'm excited about finding a role where I can put my tech skills to good use and continue growing as an IT professional.

### What I bring to the table

During my studies at Borås University, I got really into C# and the whole .NET ecosystem. I've also picked up quite a bit of experience with:

- Building web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript and React
- Working with databases (both SQL and NoSQL)
- Collaborating with others using Git and agile methods

My internship at Volvo Powertrain gave me real-world experience that I'm proud of. As my graduation project, I independently developed an API and web interface that made it easier to manage parameters across different systems. Working autonomously while consulting with senior developers, I was responsible for the entire development process from design to implementation. It was challenging work, but I enjoyed seeing how my code could solve actual business problems and create value for the organization.

### Beyond work and school

In my spare time, I love tinkering with tech projects at home. I enjoy exploring new technologies, automating everyday tasks, and building small applications that solve practical problems. Working on these personal projects has helped me develop skills in troubleshooting, finding creative solutions, and continuously learning new technologies on my own.

### How I work

I'm the kind of person who enjoys diving into new challenges and figuring things out. I work well in teams and am comfortable asking questions when needed, but I'm also good at working independently when that's what's required.
I'm looking for an environment where I can continue developing my technical skills while contributing to meaningful projects. I'm adaptable and eager to learn whatever technologies are needed for the job.
